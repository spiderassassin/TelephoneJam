* Notes for Dev 2
  * Implemented a very basic character controller, feel free to change logic however.
  * You fly be pressing w and control the direction with mouse.
  * Created a character in blender with animations. The animations were imported from mixamo.
  * The character has a cape that uses cloth physics.
  * There are also walking and falling animations that are not currently being used since the character can only fly now.
